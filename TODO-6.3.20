- fix STARTTLS timeouts by setting socket timings
  possibly using a different structure than an int to save the fd
  and SSL context -- and then also timeout?
  Or just make set_timeout take an optional fd, which, when != -1,
  also sets the socket timeouts?

- make SSLv2 removal dependent on openssl configuration
  (see Debian FTBFS bug for how to detect that in configure)

- make --with-ssl default?
